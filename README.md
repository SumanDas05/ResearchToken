The ResearchToken (RCH) and ResearchProject smart contracts facilitate blockchain-based funding for research initiatives. The ResearchToken is an ERC20 token used as the currency for contributions, while ResearchProject enables users to create, fund, and manage research projects securely and transparently.

## Project Flow:

1. **Deploy ResearchToken**
   - Initial supply of 1,000,000 RCH tokens assigned to the owner.

2. **Create ResearchProject**
   - Owner sets up new research projects specifying the name and funding goal.

3. **Fund Projects**
   - Users fund projects by transferring RCH tokens to the contract.

4. **Claim Rewards**
   - Researchers claim funds if the project meets its funding goal and is marked as completed.
